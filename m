I'm all for it, and am very happy to hand patches off to people who can deal
with them, but I'm not personally very good at navigating the process of what
linux-kernel has become:

  https://landley.net/notes-2023.html#22-02-2023

I still feel guilty about not having replied to Andrew yet, but I dunno what to
_say_:

  https://landley.net/notes-2023.html#24-02-2023

Oh, that ncp cleanup patch should also remove SMB_SUPER_MAGIC which went away in
commit 939cbe5af5fb and USBDEVICE_SUPER_MAGIC which went away in commit
fb28d58b72aa. Those symbols _also_ went away more than 10 years ago. Whole lot
of dusty corners in this codebase nobody's bothered to clean them out in forever
because touching linux-kernel actively unpleasant, so people who might otherwise
speak up about the references to 2.1 and 2.2 kernel versions being maybe a bit
stale in
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.3/Documentation/filesystems/proc.rst#:~:text=may%20change%20slightly
don't think engaging with linux-kernel is worth it. (That whole "with enough
eyeballs all bugs are shallow" thing assumes you have participation from people
outside the core group. Which stops working when your community actively drives
them away...)

*shrug* I can respin the patch if you think it's worth trying? Last time I did
something similar I had to argue with people whose entire argument was "change
bad, accumulting cruft endlessly has no downsides":

  https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1102436.html

Which is odd because as the linux-kernel community ages and shrinks it's been
throwing multiple entire drivers overboard:

  http://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers
  https://fosstodon.org/@kernellogger/109697090093536263

But "change from outsider, bad!" and "we've driven too many developers away to
maintain the existing code" only conflict if you think that a shrinking clique
circling the wagons is a problem I guess. (I admit to bias on this one...)

Cool, thanks. Some of the branches in Rich's repository have more, and I can dig
through my linux junk drawer here if your backlog runs low. :)

I believe all the j2-specific kernel patches that weren't authored by me, Rich,
or Jeff have already gone in. Kernel patches from other people in our stacks
were generally saved from this list or lkml in the first place.

In my 6.3 patch stack, 1-6 are from me, 7 was from rich, 8 was Jeff and Rich, 9
is disgusting and shouldn't go in yet (only about 1/3 of that ethernet driver is
relevant), and 10 is a one line yank of an unnecessary config constraint with
explanation (done by Rich I think, we use uio on a nommu board to talk to
bespoke USB 2.0 hardware, among other things; I dunno what the unsupported
mmap() he mentioned would try to do on nommu but assuming it doesn't panic the
kernel we're fine because only a subset of the possible mmap options are _ever_
available on nommu (you can MAP_SHARED but not MAP_PRIVATE on files, anonymous
could theoretically MA_PRIVATE with range registers but I don't think any linux
port supports them?), so mmap not working for this isn't unusual in that context.)

He's around. He's contributed to toybox and musl and gcc on and off for years:

http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/toybox-landley.net/2017-September/017217.html
https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/commit/?id=a0d64dccbc8d
https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-help/2011-04/msg00067.html

And here's him offering a kernel signed-off-by:

Yeah, I know. Alas, work on it stopped when the developer was hired by Apple:

  https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisvm/

That's actually the _second_ superh LLVM port I'm aware of, but we couldn't
convince Renesas to release theirs and it was kinda stale by that point anyway...

There's been some version skew since, but it doesn't look _that_ hard. Just... a
can of worms we've all been to busy with the other plates we're spinning to open.

I'm guessing you didn't build libstdc++? Without which you can't build a native
compiler because gcc is now written in C++. (GCC for _sh4_ works fine, including
native compiler. The sh2eb musl config builds the first pass but not the second,
some configuration that's not lining up, probably to do with fdpic given where
it broke. I need to bisect it to find out what the change was...)
