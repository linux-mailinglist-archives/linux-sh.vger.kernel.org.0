It does control (prevent) another option:

# For architectures that (ab)use NUMA to represent different memory regions
# all cpu-local but of different latencies, such as SuperH.
#
config ARCH_WANT_NUMA_VARIABLE_LOCALITY
        bool

config NUMA_BALANCING
        bool "Memory placement aware NUMA scheduler"
        depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_NUMA_BALANCING
        depends on !ARCH_WANT_NUMA_VARIABLE_LOCALITY
        depends on SMP && NUMA && MIGRATION
        help
          This option adds support for automatic NUMA aware
memory/task placement.
          The mechanism is quite primitive and is based on migrating memory when
          it has references to the node the task is running on.

          This system will be inactive on UMA systems.

The symbol was set by arch/metag, too (which was removed).
