Yes. Sorry I didn't also reply in the original thread.

I'd like to have a way to test the DMA changes or testing feedback
from someone using an affected configuration just because they're
sufficiently nontrivial (Adrian might be able to do this? If so that'd
be great; if not let me know if it's testable in qemu), but the rest
look good to go.

Big thanks for your efforts to clean all this up!
