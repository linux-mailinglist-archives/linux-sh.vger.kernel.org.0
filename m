Having "dfault y if !DRM" makes sense to me. I guess is a corner case but
at least it won't silently be disabled for users that only want fbdev as
Geert mentioned.

I wouldn't call it a regression though, because AFAIK the Kconfig options
are not a stable API ?

Funny that you mention because it's exactly what I attempted in the past:

I think we can have both to make the kernel more configurable:

1) Allow to only disable fbdev user-space APIs (/dev/fb?, /proc/fb, etc),
   which is what the series is doing with the new FB_DEVICE config symbol.

2) Allow to disable all "native" fbdev drivers and only keep the DRM fbdev
   emulation layer. That's what my series attempted to do with the FB_CORE
   Kconfig symbol.

I believe that there are use cases for both, for example as Thomas' said
many distros are disabling all the fbdev drivers and their user-space only
requires DRM/KMS, so makes sense to not expose any fbdev uAPI at all.

But may be that other users want the opposite, they have an old user-space
that requires fbdev, but is running on newer hardware that only have a DRM
driver. So they will want DRM fbdev emulation but none fbdev driver at all.

That's why I think that FB_DEVICE and FB_CORE are complementary and we can
support any combination of the two, if you agree there are uses for either.
