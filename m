It's not great.. Can you share the line on boot with the following
prefix: pcpu-alloc [1].

I'm a little surprised here because this means it's allocating not
against the right atomic size. I don't necesarily think it's an issue of
switching from percpu-vm to percpu-km.

In v5.14, I merged Roman's request for percpu depopulation [2]. This
required calls to flush the tlb. There is an abstraction layer:
percpu-vm vs percpu-km. So if an architecture is using percpu-vm but
doesn't have an MMU AND doesn't map out appropriately the tlb flush
call, then it fails. This happened on arm + sh architectures. Now RV
might be mapping it out appropriately so they never saw the issue.

Now, there is also a bigger caveat with using percpu-vm without an MMU.
In percpu-vm, we allocate pages on demand and map them in into
pre-allocated vmas. This means there are 2 scenarios that I haven't
looked into deeper. 1, the vma alloc maps to allocating physical pages.
2, we're lucky percpu allocates backwards in the vma so we haven't had a
collision problem yet.
