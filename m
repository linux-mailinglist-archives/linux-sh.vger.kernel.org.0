Thanks. I found my J2 board in the meantime.

We should get as many of these patches upstreamed as possible.

I will also continue reviewing old patches from the mailing list, I already
assembled a list of older patches many of which have not been applied.

If possible, the original author of the various J2 patches should post them
for review.

Thanks. That should be enough.

Doesn't ring a bell at the moment.

Jeff, your turn, please ;-).

While SuperH/J2 is not an official LLVM target, there is actually an LLVM toolchain
for J2, see:

GCC for SH itself works fine for me, so I assume an issue with your build environment.
