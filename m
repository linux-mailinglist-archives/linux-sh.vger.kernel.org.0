I think this is the same as "sh: boot: avoid unneeded rebuilds under
arch/sh/boot/compressed/" in commit 7fe859eef9 in linux-next, which
I've had in next but with no pull request sent for embarrassingly
long. It will be included in the PR for the new release cycle.

Sorry about the long delay. Let me know if there's anything else I
need to know about it. And thanks for the patch.
