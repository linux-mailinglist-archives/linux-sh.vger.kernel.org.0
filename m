Well, I am very sorry to see this going in as is.  It will silently
change people building with oldconfig, and anyone not paying attention
will not notice until an issue is hit where "it worked before, and my
config hasn't changed".  If EXPERT is unset, there is no notification,
just a changed behavior.  While it would be easy for me to carry a
patch dropping the if EXPERT, it will not help any users building on
upstream with our configs, whether for their own regular use, or while
trying to debug other issues,  I expect it will result in a reasonable
amount of frustration from users trying to do the right thing and
bisect or test patches upstream.

Justin
