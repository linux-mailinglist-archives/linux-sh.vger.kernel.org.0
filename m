That would still give a warning, as "unsigned long long" us 64-bit, and
"void *" is 32-bit.

Note that these are reduced config files, so auto-selected symbols are
not present in the defconfig.

config X2TLB
        def_bool y
        depends on (CPU_SHX2 || CPU_SHX3) && MMU

and e.g.

config CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7723
        bool "Support SH7723 processor"
        select CPU_SH4A
        select CPU_SHX2
