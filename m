Hmm, it looks like Andrew Morton just pulled most of these into -mm,
apparently independently of me getting them in my for-next a few hours
ago, since his versions lack my signed-off-by. That's ok though, as
long as they go up. Some details since further action is needed on a
few:

In -mm.

The first one was pulled and the second wasn't so I think the second
needs to be rewritten on top of the first now.

Not included in -mm. I'll keep it in my for-next.

The first one here is now in -mm, so further cleanup action is needed
but I think that will happen with the cross-arch patch series.

Arnd confirmed it and it's in -mm now anyway.

Actual generic-strncpy is in -mm now so I think this should be ok. If
there's a desire to use the asm, it needs fixes. Latest proposed
version is using named labels (not numbered ones) in an inline asm
block so the compiler can in theory duplicate it and break assembly.

In -mm, with followup style fix.

Missing from -mm so I'll keep it.

No action needed.
