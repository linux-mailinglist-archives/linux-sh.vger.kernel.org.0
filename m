Hi Stephen,

I completely forgot that you had the tree from our other co-maintainer
Yoshinori Sato on the list linux-next is pulling from. Would it be
okay to keep both? That would help with quickly identifying and
resolving any conflicting commits and make things go more smoothly
with two maintainers trying to be active.

Let me know if this doesn't work for you and we'll figure out
alternative arrangements.

Rich
