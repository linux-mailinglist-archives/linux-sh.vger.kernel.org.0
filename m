I was really hoping that someone else would at least comment.
I've queued it up now for 5.19.

Should we garbage-collect some of the other nommu platforms where
we're here? Some of them are just as stale:

1. xtensa nommu has does not compile in mainline and as far as I can
tell never did
   (there was https://github.com/jcmvbkbc/linux-xtensa/tree/xtensa-5.6-esp32,
which
   worked at some point, but I don't think there was enough interest
to get in merged)

2. arch/sh Hitachi/Renesas sh2 (non-j2) support appears to be in a similar state
    to h8300, I don't think anyone would miss it

8<----- This may we where we want to draw the line ----

3. arch/sh j2 support was added in 2016 and doesn't see a lot of
changes, but I think
    Rich still cares about it and wants to add J32 support (with MMU)
in the future

4. m68k Dragonball, Coldfire v2 and Coldfire v3 are just as obsolete as SH2 as
   hardware is concerned, but Greg Ungerer keeps maintaining it, along with the
   newer Coldfire v4 (with MMU)

5. K210 was added in 2020. I assume you still want to keep it.

7. Arm32 has several Cortex-M based platforms that are mainly kept for
    legacy users (in particular stm32) or educational value.
