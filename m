God bless you my beloved,
How are you and your lovely family doing I hope you are all in good
health? Meanwhile, I don=E2=80=99t know you in person but I am 100% sure th=
at
we can join our head together and achieve this great opportunity which
I request your co-operation in my desire to find a foreign partner who
will assist me in relocation and investment of an abandoned fund in
the bank where I work.  I am the personal Accountant of our deceased
customer before his accidental death.

Meanwhile, I got your contact address through my Country E-mail Data
Directory while searching for a credible and reliable foreign partner
to share this information with you over this abandoned fund ($19.3
Million) Nineteen Million Three Hundred Thousand US Dollars.

In-which I am counting on your sense of confidentiality as I desire
that you keep this business transaction top secret to yourself.

Therefore, if you are interested and willing to assist me kindly get
back to me without further delay for more details on how we could
proceed and achieve these goals successfully.

Thanks and my regards to your lovely family.
Mrs. Sandrine Nikiema Daouda.
