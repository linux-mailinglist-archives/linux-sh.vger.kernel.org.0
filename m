Note the subject line conventions in drivers/pci (use "git log
--oneline" to see them): use something like this:

  PCI: sh7751: Add SH7751 PCI host bridge driver

with no period at the end.

arch/sh/drivers/pci/pci-sh7751.h and arch/sh/drivers/pci/pci-sh7751.c
still exist after applying this series.  Better to have a single patch
that moves the content from arch/sh/drivers/pci/ to
drivers/pci/controller/.

Neither file looks like a simple move; there's a lot of reorganization
going on at the same time.  It's really difficult to review a patch
like that because we can't compare the content from before and after.

If you make a patch that does the cleanup/reorganization, and a
separate patch that is just a simple move, and you use "git mv" for
the move, git should notice that this is just a rename, and that diff
will be tiny.

One of the reorganization patches should be to incorporate the
pci-sh7751.h content directly into pci-sh7751.c.  Since it's only used
in pci-sh7751.c, there's really no advantage to having it in a
separate file.

Move this so the menu entries stay sorted by vendor name.
