I'm still not understanding -- is percpu-km.c really incompatible with
SMP? I've successfully booted with the Kconfig changed to allow it,
but it's possible that cores are just clobbering each other's percpu
memory or something, and happening not to blow up yet.

Can #ifdef CONFIG_MMU be put around the code in percpu-vm.c to make it
clear that this case is supported?

Most devices have around 128 MB of DRAM. Is that within your view of
"small"?
