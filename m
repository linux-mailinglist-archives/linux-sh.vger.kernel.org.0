Greetings

On behalf of Almighty Jehovah and Lord Jesus Christ, who give all good
things, we greet Calvary. I know this letter will come as a big
surprise to you, but I beg you to take the time to read it carefully
as the decisions you make will go a long way in determining my future
and my existence.

I'm Nola Mary Zem from New Zealand, a 58-year-old widow. I have no
children and suffer from long-term cancer disease. I have a fund that
I inherited from my husband late for $ 9.7 million, and I need a very
honest and God-fearing person who can withdraw this money and use it
for charities. I would like to provide this fund for charity work.
After praying to Jehovah, I saw your email through a personal internet
search, and if you are willing to take care to manage this trust and
funds to fulfill your last wishes before you die, I decided to contact
you. I've been trying to manage this project myself for 4 years, but
this is no longer possible.

The rest hopes to use 30% of the total amount to help you carry out
the project while doing God's work. I desperately need your help and I
have the courage to contact you about this. Don't let me down and
millions of poor people in the world today. There are no risks
associated with stealing money or 100% SAFE. If your funds are
available to charities, let us know immediately. I don't want anything
that would jeopardize my last wish, so thanks for your utmost secrecy
and trust in this matter to fulfill my wish for my heart.

God bless you
Nola Mary Zem
