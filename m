Yes, but it took a good while to get fully better, and according to
tests it wasn't even covid19. Certainly shaped my view on taking the
pandemic seriously at an appropriate time, though!

And I still have the NextVoD and LANDISK. The NextVoD is ST-based, so
not supported at all by upstream kernel, only the abandoned stlinux.
I've long wanted to pull support for ST hardware back into mainline,
and I think DT makes this viable rather than just a huge new mess on
top of undermaintained code, but it'll need help to make it happen.

Great!
