* You're linking to a Phoronix article as prove that there's a
  performance impact.

* You're complaining that you haven't been Cced even though you
  seemingly maintain mutliple filesystems that have their ML set to
  fsdevel.

* You're trying to mandate what very valuable internal VFS changes we
  get to make based on 32-bit concerns.

I don't see a single coherent argument in this list worth engaging with
- especially with that lamenting tone.

Suggestions for next time:

"I just read this article on Phoronix that mentions a potential
performance impact on 32-bit systems. Is that valid or do you think this
is going to not be an issue?"

I get that you care about 32-bit and legacy hardware a lot. But upstream
Linux has clarified multiple times that we don't jump through any extra
hoops for 32-bit anymore. This is especially true if the claimed perf
regressions so far are purely theoretical.

I don't think there's anything actionable for us here at all. Thanks
again, @Jeff for doing this work we've been talking about for multiple
years. It was about time.
