I've looked into this some more, and while arch/arm does dummy its
equivalent functions out on nommu, arch/sh has always had them as
BUG(), and indeed it makes some sense to catch erroneous usage.
pcpu_post_unmap_tlb_flush should probably have the flush under #ifdef
CONFIG_MMU or something.

I've added the author of the commit that broke this to Cc in case he
has any thoughts.
