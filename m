On the userspace toolchain and musl side, yes, I see no reason you
shouldn't be able to build musl for sh4 with fdpic ABI or build a
toolchain for sh4 that defaults to fdpic and has fdpic target-libs. I
just tested passing -mfdpic to sh4-linux-musl-gcc and it seems to
produce correct fdpic code.

On the kernel side, I'm not sure, but the normal ELF loader should be
able to load fdpic binaries on a system with mmu. It will not float
the data segment separately from text, but doesn't need to because it
has an mmu. If this is no longer working it's a kernel regression;
that's how I always tested sh2eb fdpic binaries on qemu-system-sh4eb.

It looks like there's an arch-provided function that's conditional on
!MMU in arch/sh but that, now that fdpic loader is intended to be
supported on mmu-ful systems, should be changed to be conditional on
fdpic support (or maybe even unconditional if fdpic can be loaded as a
module). Just look for where it's defined in arch/sh. If it's in a
nommu-specific file it might need to be moved somewhere more
appropriate, or an mmu-ful variant may need to be written and placed
somewhere more appropriate.

musl also supports non-fdpic ELF just fine on nommu, but it has to be
fully position independent (PIE) and of course does not get shareable
text. But this is usable for testing.

Could you file a bug report for this? I think it's actually a GCC
regression but I'm not sure, so there probably needs to be a report on
the GCC tracker.
