This was really helpful, but one thing that would make it easier if
you have any more to list is including message-ids rather than (or in
addition to) marc.info links. I had to go through and reverse them all
to message-ids (or at least subjects) to find the patches from my
mailbox to git-am.

Doesn't the second one here replace the first?

I'm trying to figure out how to apply this since it was generated with
-D and git-am maliciously rejects it for that reason with an arcane
error message.

Already upstream.

This one had objections by Geert that called for a v2, and was
teplaced by:

> > https://marc.info/?l=linux-sh&m=157839999010776&w=2

But this still had objections that the definitions on all archs should
be fixed for const correctness. It looks like that patch series is
still bouncing around; should I apply the SH part of it now?

Can anyone confirm that this is correct/safe?

Can you fill me in on the status of this? It looks like you were
following it. The subject says "use generic strncpy" but it's updating
the asm, and I think there are problems with the proposed asm.

This is already upstream.
