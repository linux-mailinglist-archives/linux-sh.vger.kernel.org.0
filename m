Well, if you phrase it like that ... no, I'm not in favor of unnecessary 
churn at all. Yes, folios were/are a lot of churn (IMHO not unnecessary, 
though).

I'm not a friend of these "overlays"; it all only really makes sense to 
me once we actually allocate the descriptors dynamically. Maybe some of 
the existing/ongoing conversions were different (that's why I was asking 
for the difference, as you said the "struct slab" thing was well received).

If they are primarily only unnecessary churn for now (and unclear 
when/how it will become useful), I share your opinion.
