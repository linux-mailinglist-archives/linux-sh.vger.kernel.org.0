I'm glad to here that you're still active. I will try to help assembling
the list of patches. I won't be able to test them though as I'm not at
home so I'm unable to reset the machine in case it crashes due to a bad
kernel patch. So, basically, I just have one shot free.

We definitely need to get all those patches merged that fix warnings as Linus
recently moved to building with -Werror by default.

I would generally be interested to help although I'm not as knowledgeable
when it comes to low-level kernel development.
