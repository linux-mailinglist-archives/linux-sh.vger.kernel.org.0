Subject: [PATCH RESEND 0/7] entry: preempt_schedule_irq() callers scrub

Hi,

This is the (RESEND of the) continuation of [1] where I'm hunting down
preempt_schedule_irq() callers because of [2].

I told myself the best way to get this moving forward wouldn't be to write
doc about it, but to go write some fixes and get some discussions going,
which is what this patch-set is about.

I've looked at users of preempt_schedule_irq(), and made sure they didn't
have one of those useless loops. The list of offenders is:

$ grep -r -I "preempt_schedule_irq" arch/ | cut -d/ -f2 | sort | uniq

  arc
  arm
  arm64
  c6x
  csky
  h8300
  ia64
  m68k
  microblaze
  mips
  nds32
  nios2
  parisc
  powerpc
  riscv
  s390
  sh
  sparc
  x86
  xtensa

Regarding that loop, archs seem to fall in 3 categories:
A) Those that don't have the loop
B) Those that have a small need_resched() loop around the
   preempt_schedule_irq() callsite
C) Those that branch to some more generic code further up the entry code
   and eventually branch back to preempt_schedule_irq()

arc, m68k, nios2 fall in A)
sparc, ia64, s390 fall in C)
all the others fall in B)

I've written patches for B). As of 5.2-rc2 mainline contains those for:
- arm64
- mips
- x86
- powerpc
- nds32

I've also got acks for:
- c6x
- xtensa

The remaining ones for which I haven't had a reply yet (hence the RESEND) are:
- csky
- h8300
- microblaze
- riscv
- sh
- sh64


Build-tested on:
- h8300
- c6x
- microblaze

Thanks,
Valentin
