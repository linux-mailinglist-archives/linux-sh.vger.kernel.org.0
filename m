Subject: [PATCH v14 6/6] Documentation: path-lookup: mention LOOKUP_MAGICLINK_JUMPED

Now that we have a special flag to signify magic-link jumps, mention it
within the path-lookup docs. And now that "magic link" is the correct
term for nd_jump_link()-style symlinks, clean up references to this type
of "symlink".
