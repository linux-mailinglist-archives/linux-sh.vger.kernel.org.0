I think we actually have the wrong commit to blame; it looks like
93274f1dd6b0 ("percpu: flush tlb in pcpu_reclaim_populated()") added
the TLB flush. However, this rabbit hole seems to go a lot deeper.
According to the comments in the files, percpu-km.c, not percpu-vm.c,
is supposed to be used on nommu archs. However, mm/Kconfig has
NEED_PER_CPU_KM depending on !SMP rather than !SMP || !MMU, which
mismatches the comments in the source. So should we be trying to fix
the Kconfig constraints to use -km? Or fixing -vm to work on nommu
like it used to?
