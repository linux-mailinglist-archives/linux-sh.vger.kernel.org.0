Indeed, if you do it that way you want to check the return value and
set the value to 0 if either faults.

BTW I'm not sure what's supposed to happen on write if half faults
after the other half already succeeded... Either a C approach or an
asm approach has to consider that.

Indeed. I don't think it's a significant difference but if kernel
folks do that's fine. In cases like this my personal preference is to
err on the side of less arch-specific asm.
