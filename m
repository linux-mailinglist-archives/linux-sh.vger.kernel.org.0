I'm surprised I haven't heard any reports of this until now. Thanks for
ccing me. Fwiw, it's generally good to cc the author / subsystem
maintainer when there is an issue.

I would need to think about it a little bit more, but I think
percpu-km.c was written more in the mindset of !MMU == !SMP. It sounds
like for superh that's not true.

Given that, if sh has no MMU, then it really should be using percpu-km.c
not percpu-vm.c as there is no notion of unpopulated pages for that
configuration. I think we should fix the Kconfig constraints and give
that a shot. I didn't have any known users of !mmu/percpu-km.c, so I
didn't want to make the changes without someone verifying it or needing
it.

Thanks,
Dennis
