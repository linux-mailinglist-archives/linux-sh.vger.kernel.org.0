Yep, 8MB, that's it.

I forgot to add here that the system was down to about 500 free pages
after boot (again from the shell with "cat /proc/vmstat").

For both slab and slub, I had cpu partial off, debug off and slab merge
on, as I suspected that would lead to less memory overhead.
I suspected memory fragmentation may be an issue but doing

echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

before trying a shell command did not help much at all (it usually does on
that board with SLOB). Note that this is all with buildroot, so this echo
& redirect always works as it does not cause a shell fork.

If you want me to test something, let me know.
