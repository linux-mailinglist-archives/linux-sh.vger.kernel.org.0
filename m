Does not say what the special handling is. Does not provide an example of said
special handling. Implied that only three do NOT need special handling, two of
which are x86 and arm, which seems... convenient.

Right, let's see what "grep -r clone arch/" says:

m68k/kernel/process.c is obviously overriding
arc/include/syscalls.h has sys_clone_wrapper()
nios2/kernel/process.c has nios2_clone()
openrisc/kernel/entry.S has __sys_clone()
sparc/kernel/process.c has sparce_clone()
h8300/kernel/process.c has its own sys_clone()
ia64/kernel/process.c has ia64_clone()
user mode linux is just weird.

So the architectures that wrap clone are m68k, arc, nios2, openrisc, sparc,
h8300, and ia64.

Implying that the ones that DON'T are alpha, arm64, hexagon, nds32, parisc,
s390, csky, microblaze, powerpc, sh, x86, arm, mips, riscv, and xtensa.

Which would mean 2/3 of architectures don't wrap clone, and thus arch/sh not
doing so isn't unusual.

$ cd arch/sh

$ grep -r clone
tools/Makefile:# Shamelessly cloned from ARM.
kernel/process_32.c:int copy_thread(unsigned long clone_flags, unsigned long
usp, unsigned long arg,
kernel/process_32.c:	if (clone_flags & CLONE_SETTLS)
kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl:120	common	clone				sys_clone
kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl:435	common	clone3				sys_clone3

$ grep -r fork
include/asm/cacheflush.h: *  - flush_cache_dup mm(mm) handles cache flushing
when forking
kernel/entry-common.S:	.globl	ret_from_fork
kernel/entry-common.S:ret_from_fork:
kernel/cpu/init.c: * state prior to hand forking the idle loop.
kernel/process_32.c:asmlinkage void ret_from_fork(void);
kernel/process_32.c:	p->thread.pc = (unsigned long) ret_from_fork;
kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl:2	common	fork				sys_fork
kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl:190	common	vfork				sys_vfork

Hard to prove a negative, but I'm not seeing any wrappers. It's got some
callbacks, but I think the existing plumbing is calling them already?
