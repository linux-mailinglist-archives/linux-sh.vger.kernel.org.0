Hi. I see there's a situation that needs my attention here. I will
plan to review and merge anything important/blocking that doesn't have
problems this week.

In the bigger picture, the past few weeks and even months I've been in
a sort of "avoid burnout safety mode". :-) Probably partly on account
of this pandemic still being a thing because people insist on being
stupid. I'm not gone and won't be, but some things that haven't seemed
as urgent, including kernel stuff and especially piles of email of
mixed importance levels, have gotten pushed back to reduce stress.
Please don't hesitate to wave a "hey this is important, come take a
quick look!" flag at me if needed.

At the same time, I am open to the possibility of a new maintainer or
co-maintainer if that ends up being what makes sense. Are there any
candidates?

Rich
