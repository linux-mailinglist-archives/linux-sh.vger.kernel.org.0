You are right. I missed the use of cpumask_of_bp().

Actually!
This is somewhat orthogonal to the optimizations you are doing, but
the most interesting case for us is inherited events. And it seems
that an inherited event can't possibly overflow the capacity.
Inherited events are a subset of the parent events and all parent
events have already passed validation and the child can't have its own
new events when inherited events are created.
So couldn't we somehow detect that reserve_bp_slot() is called from
inherit_event() and skip fetch_bp_busy_slots() altogether? Maybe that
can be detected by looking at bp->attr.inherit and presence of parent
context? Capacity validation may be kept as a debug-only check.
